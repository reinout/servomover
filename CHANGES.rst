Changelog for servomover
========================

0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.2 (2015-11-17)
----------------

- Servo now gets 20 milliseconds to reach the initial position before the
  servo is detached. This way I get the fixed initial position *without* any
  dithering.

- Note: this is a fully working version. I can steer a german hp0/hp1/hp2
  signals with two servos with this library!
